          Mode and place of processing the Data
        </h2>
        <h3 className="font-bold">Methods of processing</h3>
        <p>
          The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized
          access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of the
          Data. The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT
          enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly
          related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some
          cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in
          charge, involved with the operation of this Application
          (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or
          external parties (such as third-party technical service providers,
          mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications
          agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner.
          The updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at
          any time.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold"> Legal basis of processing</h3>
        <p>
          The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the
          following applies: Users have given their consent for one or more
          specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be
          allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such
          processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other
          of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever
          the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection
          law; provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an
          agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations
          thereof; processing is necessary for compliance with a legal
          obligation to which the Owner is subject; processing is related to a
          task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
          official authority vested in the Owner; processing is necessary for
          the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a
          third party. In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the
          specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular
          whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual
          requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold">Place</h3>
        <p>
          The Data is processed at the Owner&#39;s operating offices and in any
          other places where the parties involved in the processing are located.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on the User&#39;s location, data transfers may involve
          transferring the User&#39;s Data to a country other than their own. To
          find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data,
          Users can check the section containing details about the processing of
          Personal Data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data
          transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any
          international organization governed by public international law or set
          up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security
          measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking
          the relevant sections of this document or inquire with the Owner using
          the information provided in the contact section.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold">Retention time</h3>
        <p>
          Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by
          the purpose they have been collected for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore: Personal Data collected for purposes related to the
          performance of a contract between the Owner and the User shall be
          retained until such contract has been fully performed. Personal Data
          collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall
          be retained as long as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find
          specific information regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the
          Owner within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting
          the Owner. The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a
          longer period whenever the User has given consent to such processing,
          as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may
          be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever
          required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon
          order of an authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted.
          Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to
          rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced
          after expiration of the retention period.

        <h2 className="font-bold">The rights of Users</h2>

          Verify and seek rectification. Users have the right to verify the
          accuracy of their Data and ask for it to be updated or corrected.
          Restrict the processing of their Data. Users have the right, under
          certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of their Data. In
          this case, the Owner will not process their Data for any purpose other

        </p>
        <p>

          structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if
          technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller
          without any hindrance. This provision is applicable provided that the
          Data is processed by automated means and that the processing is based
          on the User&#39;s consent, on a contract which the User is part of or
          on pre-contractual obligations thereof. Lodge a complaint. Users have
          the right to bring a claim before their competent data protection
          authority.

          Details about the right to object to processing
        </h3>
        <p>
          Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in the
          exercise of an official authority vested in the Owner or for the
          purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, Users may
          object to such processing by providing a ground related to their
          particular situation to justify the objection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed
          for direct marketing purposes, they can object to that processing at
          any time without providing any justification. To learn, whether the
          Owner is processing Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, Users
          may refer to the relevant sections of this document.

          through the contact details provided in this document. These requests
          can be exercised free of charge and will be addressed by the Owner as
